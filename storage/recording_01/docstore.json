I' m nenhum fod yn cler Dave aeg<|cy|> yna. I'm Sue Carp and Der with a deep ye and I'm the sales director. I want to do you get us the new HR manager. Okay, I'm just the next item. Are there any matters of rising from the previous minutes? No. Fine. Well, next item on the agenda. I'd like Lucy to talk us through her thoughts on this. Well, there's been actually a problem with car parking. You know, ever since you looked at your shipment, moved into the new offices at the back. And we knew this would happen eventually, but you know, our stuff I've got used to the exercise space is. And what's happened to be in a few arguments, there was a really bad one, where one of our lot, Completed one of their lot, which is really bad, because we're trying to like, you see, just started with a bad reputation. So what we need to do is let one, you know, our lot know that the space is belong to them, actually. I'm sorry, are you saying there is a problem with car parking? You see, I didn't quite catch all of what you said. Yeah. And also, another of the sales team need their car throughout the day. And they want to know what the company proposes to do about this issue. No, I'm not sure. We need to send an email letting all the staff know that only five spaces belong to us. Well, I think we should think about priority parking as well. But anyway, we're going to stop people rowing on a regular basis. Sorry, I got held up in a previous meeting. Okay, it's okay. We're just discussing car parking, yes, it is. Right. Are you riding a bike? Yes, I do, too. Are you riding a bike? Yes. Oh, really? And does he have a bell on it? Actually, he does. Please, come and get back. Okay, I mentioned priority parking. We need to make a decision on this. I witnessed a fight last week between two members of staff. I've stopped exaggerating. It's just a heated discussion. I was perfectly in my right to stand up for myself. Some losers came up to me and said, my car has taken up two parking spaces. Now, that's just ridiculous. Well, you do drive a tank and it does take up two spaces. I think priority parking is a good idea, Julian. Thank you. I think that anyone that needs their car for work and uses it during work hours should be given priority at the sales team. What happens if one of them is off-sick? So can we just decide on the priority spaces first? Well, I can think of about four people on the sales team that use their cars regularly.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3311, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28903ac8-114d-4f14-86ae-f5d56bd26e24": {"__data__": {"id_": "28903ac8-114d-4f14-86ae-f5d56bd26e24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "recording_01/simulated_meeting.mp3", "file_name": "simulated_meeting.mp3", "file_type": "audio/mpeg", "file_size": 6854757, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4975f418-95cc-470e-9d99-d52a1b565dc4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "recording_01/simulated_meeting.mp3", "file_name": "simulated_meeting.mp3", "file_type": "audio/mpeg", "file_size": 6854757, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "1c92699e793c1f863922b5a19c9cc50bb4ccf7d1124a4bec5a31e498b061d8d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e92b861-6f4a-42d8-9b44-6aa4c5296aef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "recording_01/simulated_meeting.mp3", "file_name": "simulated_meeting.mp3", "file_type": "audio/mpeg", "file_size": 6854757, "creation_date": "2024-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-03", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-03"}, "hash": "5612288093afb753bdab700b3fb7421d25fda0b24d245e44a43a4586204ed982", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f07b8a8-dd32-4039-9ba9-8264856c6413", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7dc14d45c1bf81a7787c1b96eebde5598d3800ca59d6b9bdc88008048d897fc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Please, come and get back.

So can we just decide on the priority spaces first? Well, I can think of about four people on the sales team that use their cars regularly. I'll get back to often the meeting, but I'm pretty sure it's full. Well, that should leave enough space for management. Provided that is that Jason gives up the tractor. How about two car parking spaces for visitors as well? Oh. Respect to clients, might be their spaces. Completely forgot about that. Actually, yes. Let's make it three. Three. Oh, please. Would you both put your phones away? It's very distracting. Okay. Right, three spaces. As it's a difficult area to park with a two-hour restriction and client meetings are always running over. That would leave us with two spaces left to be allocated. Have I got a space? Rita Rita, client meetings shouldn't be running over two-hour hours. I mean, we're in a 40-minute max. Well, I have different types of meeting from you. Yes, but if meetings overrun, I mean clients just switch off and get bored. Really? Yeah, can we please get back to the agenda, I don't have another meeting to go to. The car park is not only soup for me as I travel by bicycle, as does Frank. Look, I suggest Sue and Jason are allocated the two spaces. I don't mean to be petty, but Jason really does take up two spaces. Excuse me, I would like to say. If you park by the garages in the corner, where you normally park, you can normally be okay there. So let's have him have that parking space. Jason, you need to park by the garages. And I'll coordinate, letting the next priority member know if anyone is off sick. Okay, great. So could we all agree that we send a list to all staff advising them about the priority parking? Is that okay? Great. And if anyone was listening, I'll send it. Also think that if anybody parks inconsiderately that they should lose their car park in privilege. Oh. What's the one thing about that? Lucy? What did you name? Yeah, it's right. Okay, that settles that. settles what? Lots of privilege or parking by the garage. Both. All right, so I'll put a sign up with my name on it, my parking space. Can you put a sign up on all the spaces, Jason? Oh, okay, why don't I get a list and then I'll circulate it so there's no confusion? Fine Jason, you do it. So can I just... Okay, okay. Moving on to the next item on the agenda, uh, staff morale. Sue, can you explain the background to this? Sue has identified a growing problem with staff morale. Can you all refer to the issue report? I wish Clyde was here. I mean, actually he really needs to be here. No, it doesn't. I'm here. Why does he need to be here? Please, carry on. Well, there is a concern in some departments that there is low staff morale. This is indicated by the recent low sales figures. I'd also increased sickness absence in some of the departments. I'm sorry, I don't seem to have a record. Right, well, there seems to be a significance problem with staff morale in the sales team and also sickness absence. And also, company-wide, particularly on Mondays and Fridays. There is definitely low morale in the company in certain departments. New changes that have been introduced like the IT system.

People just want to know why certain people have left, why there's been restructuring, and whether their jobs are safe. Yeah, this just garset, it sounds like excuses and laziness to them. Anyway, it clearly is the case that sales figures are at their lowest since February last year. And it's mainly to do with amount of absences from the sales team. The recent launch of Comix Software has caused problems too, because it seems that people haven't had enough training and are therefore making a number of mistakes. I've done my best. It's a big department. I would like to say that the basic instruction handout was given out, and everyone was shown step-by-step, easy steps about how this should be done. And everyone was provided with, well, should have been provided. Well, no, actually they were provided with a password that would allow them to log into the new system. It's okay, so what has this got to do with staff morale? Here's what people are struggling with in new software, making mistakes, it slows them down, it demotivates them. Anyway, if you could all look at the second report, Lucy and I produced an anonymous questionnaire to get feedback from staff about issues. If you have a look, you'll see very clearly the feedback statistics. And Lucy, I don't mean to pick on you, but you were given a password. And like everyone else, you seem to have mislated or lost it. And then you email me. But what is this losing of forgetting passwords got to do with low morale? And also, everyone puts down poor management when you talk about morale. It's just a waste of time, these questionnaires. Look, there are issues that have been raised. Things like lack of training, lack of effective appraisals. I do appraisals. Well, what's the last time you conducted a staff appraisal? Anyway, the point is that we need to be working a little harder to get people on side. And we also found out from the questionnaire that some of the issues are to do with the recently structuring, the job losses, poor management in some departments, and also, as I've mentioned, the lack of training on the new software. Well, thank you for that, Sue. You do seem to have taken on a lot recently. Look, as there are a few reasons, what would you say was the predominant reason? So, we begin to tackle one at a time, maybe start working on the major one first. I think there might be a good idea if you and I had a separate meeting about that. Why don't we move on to the second issue now? Well, okay, we can hold on that, but maybe we could have one after this meeting. But, you know, Sue, these issues really need to be dealt with now. Okay, I take your point, but I do wish Clive was here. Okay, maybe we could discuss the newer appraisal system now. We could have an award tonight. Some sort of evening to boost morale. Yeah, yeah, get the all-cute company experience. Perfect. Some sort of team challenge. Get everyone pulling together. Maybe in the daytime first. Yeah, what about go-carting?

I'm glad you consider everyone, Jason. Okay, so we'll ask the staff, then we'll put it through a vote. Yeah, great idea. So we'll give them some options, put it through a vote, and then they'll be no excuse for anything, plates. Okay, time's ticking on. Can we all have a thing come up for some ideas for the next meeting, and then at the meeting meeting, decide on about six and put it to a company, but, yeah? Why don't we decide on those things now while they're still fresh in everybody's minds? Yeah, and those issues do need a dressing now. Okay, so what do we got? We have go-cutting, a war tonight, party for lattes, darts, and drinking evenings. We need more than that. Let's all come up with four and email them over in the next two days, and I'll take it from there. So, moving on, yes, IT issues. So what are the IT issues? I heard there was a problem on Friday, and I was in St. Olbans with a new client. Friday's issues took me quite a long time to investigate. In fact, it took me pretty much all of my afternoon. The F-drive backup recovery disassociated itself somehow from the PCP main framework. I found that this was a problem dating back to the beginning of last month when the PCP was originally reinstalled. Somehow quite a large component from the logative rebix hadn't been installed in the reinstallation. Indeed, this was also a problem with the external energy source administration detail being overlooked. Frank, just try to explain that back to us as a 5-year-old, would you? Oh, geez. Shall I continue? Oh. There was an external energy issue preventing us from powering up our mainframe and subfeeders. Do you mean there was a power cut, Frank? Yes, in simple terms. Thank you. So how could we avoid this happening again? I guess it would be a matter of contacting the electricity supplier. Pay the electricity bill? Yes. Can we minute accounts? Please play the electricity bills on time. Agreed? Agreed. Thank you. And maybe we should have sent Frank on an effective communication school course. Agreed, yeah? Right, moving swiftly on. What about the training issue? Oh, I've been thinking about that and I've got an idea but I want to run it past live first. Maybe we could say that for our next meeting? Oh. Okay, but I mean I think we should have that meeting sooner rather than later. Okay, in the next two weeks? Well, not everybody needs to be there. I like myself and Clive and Frank because it's relevant to them. But I think I should be there as well. That's my final decision too, thank you. I'll speak with Clive and let you know date, Frank. Moving on, yes, Gary couldn't attend today so he's provided us with a financial report. Which in summary, well we've had a tough year. The balance sheets about even and we're doing pretty well in contract sales so thanks very much for that. On the downside, what's the revenue in handset sales abroad? How much are we down on last year? I mean Gary's layout here is quite confusing. Let's take a here. 52 or 21, I mean I'm not familiar with this kind of financial report. He seems to have changed it. That's a big difference. Let me just have a look. I've got a bit of accounting experience. Thanks Julian. You know that's a lot.

Have you seen the state of the shower room? Yeah, can I just say? Try to put it in there. Yes you should because you ride your bike. Okay we've got a general cleanliness problem.

And then you email me. But what is this losing of forgetting passwords going to do with low morale? And also, everyone puts down poor management when we talk about morale. It's just a waste of time, these questionnaires. Look, there are issues that have been raised. Things like lack of training, you know, lack of effective appraisals. I do appraisals. Well, I'm just the last time you've conducted a start of appraisal. Anyway, the point is that we need to be working a little harder to get people on side. And we also found out from the questionnaire that there's some issues are to do with the recently structuring, the job losses, poor management in some departments. And also, as I've mentioned, the lack of training on the new software. Well, thank you for that, Sue. You do seem to have taken on a lot recently. Look, as there are a few reasons, what would you say was the predominant reason, so that we begin to tackle one at a time, maybe start work on the major one first? Well, I think it might be a good idea if you and I had a separate meeting about that. Why don't we move on to the second issue now? Well, okay, we can hold on that, but maybe we've got one after this meeting. But, you know, Sue, these issues really need to be dealt with now. Okay, I take your point, but I do wish Clive was here. Okay, maybe we could discuss the newer appraisal system now. We could have an awards night. Some sort of evening to boost morale. Yeah, yeah, get dual-cook company experience. Perfect. Well, some sort of team challenge. Get everyone pulling together. Maybe in the daytime first. Yeah, what about go-carting? Is that a team challenge? What about party Pilates? What? Darts. Guys like darts. Everyone's a winner. It's quite a good idea, actually. Yeah, and I like darts. No, I don't like darts. I think we should send a questionnaire rather than managing it, deciding what motivates the team. Darts. No, no, I might kill someone. I'm glad you consider everyone chasing them. Okay, so when I ask the staff, then we'll put it to a vote. Yeah, great idea. So we'll go them some options, put it to a vote, and then there'll be no excuse for any complaints. Okay, and time's ticking on. Can we all have a thing come up for some ideas for the next meeting, and then at the meeting meeting, decide on about six and put it to a company vote, yeah? Why don't we decide on those things now while they're still fresh in everybody's minds? Yeah, and those issues do need a dressing now. Okay, so what do we got?

Let's all come up with four and email them over in the next two days, and I'll take it from there. So moving on, yes, IT issues. So what are the IT issues? I heard there was a problem on Friday, and I was in St. Albums with a new client. Friday's issues took me quite a long time to investigate. In fact, it took me pretty much all of my afternoon. The F-drive backup recovery disassociated itself somehow from the PCP main framework. I found that this was a problem dating back to the beginning of last month when the PCP was originally reinstalled. Somehow quite a large component from the logative rebix hadn't been installed in the reinstallation. Indeed, this was also a problem with the external energy source administration detail being overlooked. Frank, just try to explain that back to us as a quick five-year-old, would you? Oh, geez. Shall I continue? There was an external energy issue preventing us from powering up our mainframe and sub-feeders. Do you mean there was power cut, Frank? Yes, in simple terms. Thank you. So how could we avoid this happening again? I guess it would be a matter of contacting the electricity supplier. Pay the electricity bill? Yes. Can we minute accounts please play the electricity bills on time? Agreed? Agreed. Agreed. Thank you. And maybe we should have sent Frank on an effective communication skills course. Agreed, yeah? Right, moving swiftly on. What about the training issue? Oh, I've been thinking about that, and I've got an idea, but I want to run it class live first. Maybe we could say that for our next meeting? Okay, but I mean I think we should have that meeting sooner rather than later. Okay. In the next two weeks? Well, not everybody needs to be there. I like myself and Clive and Frank, because it's relevant to them. But I think that I should be there as well. That is it. That's my final decision, Sue. Thank you. I'll speak with Clive and let you know date, Frank. Moving on, yes, Gary couldn't attend today, so he's provided us with a financial report. Which in summary, well, we've had a tough year. The balance sheets about even, and we're doing pretty well in contract sales, so thanks very much for that. On the downside, the loss of revenue in handset sales abroad. How much are we down on last year? I mean Gary's layout here is quite confusing. This bigger here, 52 or 21. I mean, I'm not familiar with this financial report. He seems to have changed it. That's a big difference. Let me just have a look. I've got a bit of accounting experience. Thanks, Julian. You know, that's a lot. Seriously, I mean, what could be the... It's actually neither of those numbers. It's 11. Are we in red or black? Well, I think if we can't pair a utility bill, I think we're in the red. Actually, we are in the black, but we're down on last year. Okay, well, thank you for that. I think that's about all for this meeting. Just leaves us with any other business. Yeah, the people are leaving plates aren't washing their plates. No kitchen. What is this? This thing. On the same note, actually, the shower room.
